/*5. Data Analysis in Marketing
As a data analyst in a marketing firm, you're given a 1D array containing customer 
satisfaction scores. Your goal is to find the range of these scores, which is defined as the 
difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. This range will help the 
marketing team understand the variability in customer satisfaction. Can you develop a Java 
program that quickly identifies the range of values in this dataset? */
